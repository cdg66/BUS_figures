## What is IP-Bus?

 Its a serial bus design to aggregate to a single differential pair a multiple of low speed serial bus found in modern electronics.
 As low speed serial bus examples are UART, SPI, I2C, I2S, SPDIF, CAN,etc.

IP-Bus is also great for general purpose communication between controller because of its simple porotocol.

## Bus design

The Bus is based on the M-LVDS(aka, TIA/EIA-899) and it<s design to support multipoint from the get go.
## Packet achitecture
