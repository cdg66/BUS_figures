# Idea notes

things I would like to add to the spec but not sure of there implementation is feaseble.

## Power over twisted pair (POTP)

Wild idea to send power aswel of data over a same twisted pair. We would only need 3 cable instead of 4: A,B,Ground. A power-data decoupler would need to be used before the tranciver.

## have 2 specification

like RISC-V there is two spec privilegied and unprivileged specification. We could do the same for SHER-Bus.

### SHER-Bus Multipoint



### SHER-Bus Point to Point

High speed but only between 2 controler. Use of LVDS instead  SHER-Bus PTP can be connected to a SHER-Bus MTP trough an end bridge.
